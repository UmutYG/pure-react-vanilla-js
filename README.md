## Purpose

This project demonstrates how to build a simple React application without using `create-react-app` or Vite. The goal is to provide a better understanding of React by using vanilla JavaScript and CDN links for React and ReactDOM.

## Project Overview

The Pure React Text Converter is a web application that allows users to convert text input into either uppercase or lowercase. The application features:

- A text area for input.
- Buttons to switch between uppercase and lowercase conversion modes.
- A read-only text area that displays the converted text in real-time.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
3. Enter text in the input area.
4. Click the "UPPERCASE MODE" or "lowercase mode" buttons to convert the text.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and script for the React app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.

## Key Features

- Utilizes vanilla JavaScript to handle React components.
- Implements state and effect hooks for dynamic text conversion.
- Demonstrates a simple yet effective way to work with React without additional build tools.
